# React Tailwind CSS Starter

This is quite literally [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) already embedded and installed using their own instructions.

In this setup we're using CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override), rather than react-scripts.

## Start the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Build the application

### `npm run build`
